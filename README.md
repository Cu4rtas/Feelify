# Feelify

Feelify is a minimalist application that will help you to make your bullet journaling a bit more funny.

With Feelify, you can trace your days a bit easier, follow your emotions, type what you did, rate your days on a scale of one to five, and even leave a song to remember it (That one that you sang the whole day in your mind).

Feelify is completely transparent, you are the only person with access to your data, we won't store anything, since the app doesn't even have any backend server. 

This app is completely free, with no DLCs or micro-transactions. That's because we're working on it with a tons of love and hoping that this may help someone anytime. You can leave us a feedback anytime at our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/gTKkbu), or you can even support us through [Donations](/#) section at the app

Also, we're pretty inspired in other proyects with this purpose, such as [Pixels](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ar.teovogel.yip)

Hope you enjoy it, and we will be waiting your feedback:)
